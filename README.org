#+title: Stamps
#+startup: overview

So we want like a semantic tour of the program, to ensure that all functionality has been completed in some way.
Also, check todos in VS Code.

* Functionality
** Logs
*** DONE Make a Log
*** DONE Delete a Log
*** DONE Rename a Log
*** DONE Set a due date for a log as a calendar date
*** DONE Set a due date for a log as a weekday
*** DONE Set a goal for a log
*** DONE View all Logs Sequentially
*** DONE View all Logs Sorted by
**** DONE Name
**** DONE Creation Time (ids)
**** DONE Number of Stamps
**** DONE Most Recently Stamped
*** DONE Sort Can Be Reversed
*** TODO View all Logs Sorted by Dynamic Views
General view should exclude logs scheduled for deletion.
**** DONE Needs Attention
This view combines any logs which have a due date which has not arrived (soonest first), then any log with a goal set which is yet to have been met.
**** TODO Completed
This view shows logs within a certain victory time threshold which have either a due date or a goal and have been completed.
***** TODO (should completed have different vanishing threshold?)
**** TODO Archived
This view is where old or ignored logs "go". Any log which has either no stamps or its most recent stamp occurred beyond the archiving threshold.
**** TODO Scheduled for Deletion
***** TODO (deleting log without timestamps is immediate)
***** TODO (deleting log with timestamps adds id to queue with ms current time)
***** TODO (upon program start, checks and deletes logs after the config value)
**** TODO (views are always available and appear only when they have content)
**** TODO Overdue
This view shows when a log has a deadline which has already passed, and the log has no stamps.
*** DONE View information about an individual Log
**** DONE Name
**** DONE Due Date
**** DONE Goal Status
**** DONE Number of Stamps
**** DONE Individual Stamps
*** TODO Edit information about an individual Log
**** DONE Name
**** TODO Due Date
**** TODO Goal
*** DONE Add local storage
*** TODO Write Data Spec and Enforce it
*** DONE Fix localStorage Cofx warning
** System
*** Statistics Page
A page to show general user statistics, such as total number of stamps, logs, first and most recent timestamp, etc.
* Glossary
** Log
A log is something the user wants to track interaction with. It is a collection of timestamps. It may contain a due date, either once or weekly, or a goal of a certain number of stamps within a given time period. This program is ultimately a log sorter, and is designed to present the user with what they want to keep in the forefront of their own minds.
** Stamp
A stamp is the symbolic representation of a timestamp upon a log. In the data, it is the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
** Ledger
A ledger is a collection of logs. Many ledgers are "virtual" in the sense that they are derived and dynamic based on the user's data. The user may also create a ledger to organize logs, if they choose.
* Long-Term Goals
** Multiple Stamp Types
Stamps with individual IDs, names, appearances, etc.
